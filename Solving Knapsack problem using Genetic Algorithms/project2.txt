    Solving Knapsack problem using Genetic Algorithms

1 Assignment

In the programming language of your choice (although Python or Java is recommended),
implement a GA which solves the 0-1 Knapsack problem which we discussed in our
lectures. Your program should meet the following criterias:

    • Weights and values of the items and capacity of the knapsack should be given to
the program using a text file.

    • The following variables should be given to program as a command line parameter.

        ◦ Size of population

        ◦ Number of generation

        ◦ Crossover probability

        ◦ Mutation probability

    • The program should implement the following methods for the corresponding task.

        ◦ Parent selection: Roulette-wheel selection

        ◦ Crossover: n-point crossover (Parameter n should be given by user)

        ◦ Survival selection: Any selection method with elitism.
